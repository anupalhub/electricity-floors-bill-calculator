# Electricity Bill Calculator for Seperate Floors of Building

This AngularJS HTML page will give you option to add as many floors you need and also give you option to print the final calculations.

Basically it will proportionally and accurately divide Official Electricity Bill (OEB) total amount for all floors based upon each consumption units recorded.

Sometime or everytime the sum of units recorded by each floor doesn't match at all with OEB total units reported. So this calculator will also divide the difference outcome proportional to each consumptions. 
 
The fixed amount like Rental is however added up equally to al floors.
